title: Taking Multi-Objective Games to the Next Level

event: Invited Talk

location: University of Galway, Ireland

summary: An overview of multi-objective games intended to provide intuitions and insights into recent results.
abstract: 'Multi-objective games are an active area of research with many potential applications. In this talk, we will consider these games starting from the basics and relate them to other well-known models in game theory. Special attention will be paid to the solution concept of Nash equilibria as well. The overarching aim is to provide you with an intuition for these games and when and how to use them.'
