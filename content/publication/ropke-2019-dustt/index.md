abstract: 'We develop and demonstrate a speech-to-text engine for Dutch, starting
  from the open-source project DeepSpeech and using the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands.
  The DuStt engine provides models targeted towards Dutch, Flemish or speakers from
  both Belgium and The Netherlands. Users can upload or record their own input as
  well as load pre-recorded samples and obtain a transcription on the spot. The demonstration
  is video available at: https://youtu.be/DtTK0uo5W7s.'
