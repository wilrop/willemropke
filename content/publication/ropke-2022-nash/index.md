abstract: We provide an in-depth study of Nash equilibria in multi-objective normal-form
  games (MONFGs), i.e., normal-form games with vectorial payoffs. Taking a utility-based
  approach, we assume that each player's utility can be modelled with a utility function
  that maps a vector to a scalar utility. In the case of a mixed strategy, it is meaningful
  to apply such a scalarisation both before calculating the expectation of the payoff
  vector as well as after. This distinction leads to two optimisation criteria. With
  the first criterion, players aim to optimise the expected value of their utility
  function applied to the payoff vectors obtained in the game. With the second criterion,
  players aim to optimise the utility of expected payoff vectors given a joint strategy.
  Under this latter criterion, it was shown that Nash equilibria need not exist. Our
  first contribution is to provide a sufficient condition under which Nash equilibria
  are guaranteed to exist. Secondly, we show that when Nash equilibria do exist under
  both criteria, no equilibrium needs to be shared between the two criteria, and even
  the number of equilibria can differ. Thirdly, we contribute a study of pure strategy
  Nash equilibria under both criteria. We show that when assuming quasiconvex utility
  functions for players, the sets of pure strategy Nash equilibria under both optimisation
  criteria are equivalent. This result is further extended to games in which players
  adhere to different optimisation criteria. Finally, given these theoretical results,
  we construct an algorithm to compute all pure strategy Nash equilibria in MONFGs
  where players have a quasiconvex utility function.
